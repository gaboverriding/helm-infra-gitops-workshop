This repo is part of the [ArgoCD Managing Infrastructure workshop](https://romerobu.github.io/manual-workshop-infra/manual-workshop-infra/index.html) and is intended to deploy day 2 operations using helm charts.. 

This repo follows an umbrella chart approach and dependencies are disabled by default. Take a look to [section 4](https://romerobu.github.io/manual-workshop-infra/manual-workshop-infra/04-day2-config.html#daytwooperations) to the steps on how to deploy these charts.
